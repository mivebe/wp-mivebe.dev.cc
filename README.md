This is a non-serious WP website I created alongside a tutorial series.
I used it to try out plugins and ayouts , it is highly overcluttered with various snips for dumping purposes.
I do not own most of the media i used the rest are free edited by me or made by redditors.

Made with:
 - Desktop Server (local working environment)
 - WordPress
 - Astre Theme (free version)
 - Elementor Page Editor (free version)
 - Dozen of plugins out of the WP ecosystem
 
 Features:
  - Responsive Navbar and Footer optimized for all devices
  - Hero and call to action
  - Media, text and icon effects and embedding
  - wooComerce shop
  - Contacts form & Map location
